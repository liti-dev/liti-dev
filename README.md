### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development, aiming to become a Fullstack developer to turn all my ideas into real life projects.<br>
:high_brightness: Fun fact: 
- I've been through several roles (consultant, accountant, teacher, and still counting...)
- I believe in :santa: who will give me a Raspberry Pi one day.
- I don't watch romance. Detectives/ Thrillers are my fav genres.
