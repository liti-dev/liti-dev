### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development, aiming to become a Fullstack developer to turn all my ideas into real life projects.<br>
âš¡ Fun fact: 
- I've taken on several roles (consultant, accountant, teacher, and still counting...)
- Waiting for :santa: to give me a Raspberry Pi
- I don't watch romance. Detectives/ Thrillers are my fav genres
