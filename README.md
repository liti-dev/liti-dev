### Hi there 👋
👩🏻‍💻 I’m a Frontend developer, aiming to become Fullstack to turn all my ideas into reality.<br>
🔭 I'm passionate about education, healthcare, animals and all things sustainability.  
🌿 I'm an introvert at heart but you may find me speaking about Green Software.

⚡ Technologies I use:

:high_brightness: Fun fact: 
- I've been through several roles (edu consultant, accountant, teacher, etc.) before working in tech.
- I don't watch romance. Sci-fi, Detectives and Thrillers are my fav.
- I'm quite good at cooking.
