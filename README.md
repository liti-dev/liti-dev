👩🏻‍💻 I’m a Frontend Developer, aiming to become Fullstack to turn all my ideas into reality.  
🔭 I'm passionate about education, healthcare, animals and all things sustainability.  
🌿 I'm an introvert at heart but you may find me on stage speaking about Green Software.

## Fun fact: 
- I've been through several roles (edu consultant, accountant, teacher, etc.) before working in tech.
- I don't watch Romance. Sci-fi, Detectives and Thrillers are my favourites.
- I'm quite good at cooking.

## Technologies I use:
